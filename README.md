# CI/CD Flask App Deployment with Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Flask web application using a modern CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure leverages Docker for containerization, AWS ECS for container orchestration, and GitHub Actions for automation. This pipeline ensures efficient, scalable, and secure deployment for web apps.

## üéØ Features
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework.
- **Docker**: Containerized the application for consistent environment.
- **AWS ECS (Fargate)**: Scalable container orchestration with Amazon ECS.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying the app.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Uses IAM roles for secure AWS interactions and scaling through ECS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to package the app.
- **AWS ECS**: Elastic Container Service for deploying containers.
- **AWS ECR**: Elastic Container Registry for storing Docker images.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation.
- **Terraform** *(Optional)*: Infrastructure-as-code for AWS resources.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the Flask app:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t flask-app .
    ```

4. Run the Flask app locally:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
    ```

5. Follow the steps in the [CI/CD Pipeline section](#cicd-pipeline-setup) to set up the pipeline.

## üìù CI/CD Pipeline Setup

1. **Dockerize the Flask app**: Create a `Dockerfile` to build the app image.
2. **Push image to AWS ECR**: Use AWS CLI to authenticate and push your image.
3. **Create ECS Task & Service**: Set up ECS task definitions and services for Fargate.
4. **Automate with GitHub Actions**: Create a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
